## Renoise Tools

This site contains various complete scripting tools written by the Renoise team. The existing tools may help you to get more info about how your tools could be done.

Please note: Most of the tools are outdated and no longer maintained, so this repository exists mainly as inspiration for new tools.

Please have a look at the [Renoise Tools Page](http://tools.renoise.com/) for more current tools.

### Renoise Scripting Documentation

If you want to create your own tools, please read the [Renoise Scripting Development Book](https://renoise.github.io/xrnx).

This book is highly recommended for anyone who wants to get into all this Renoise scripting. Please read it first to get an overview of what's needed to develop tools for Renoise. It contains an introduction, some tutorials and the full API documentation.
